Prepare to witness a magical act of vanishing, not by a magician's sleight of hand, but through clever geometry! 

The "Disappearing Bicyclist" is a classic vanishing puzzle, designed to trick the eye and challenge perception. It's a fascinating example of how our brains interpret visual information.It was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Loyd">Samuel Loyd</a>, a renowned puzzle designer.

## Position A: Thirteen Bicyclists Appear

At Position A, when you carefully assemble the puzzle and count the figures, you will find **thirteen** distinct bicyclists. Every rider seems complete and accounted for.

## Position B: Twelve Bicyclists Remain!

Now, with a slight rotation of the disc to Position B, one bicyclist mysteriously vanishes into thin air! Count again, and you'll only find **twelve** bicyclists. Where did the thirteenth one go? The scene looks almost identical, yet a figure is missing.

## The Secret Revealed: How Does It Work?

So, where does the bicyclist go? Does he ride off the edge of the card or simply dematerialize? The answer is a brilliant piece of visual trickery based on geometric principles!

The "disappearance" is an illusion created by the **clever redistribution of the parts** that make up the bicyclists' bodies.

1.  **Segmented Figures:** Each bicyclist you see is not drawn as a single, indivisible entity. Instead, they are composed of multiple segments (e.g., part of a head, a section of a torso, a piece of a wheel). The rotating disc carries some of these segments, and the background card carries others.
2.  **Subtle Growth and Rearrangement:** When the 13th bicyclist "disappears," his constituent parts are not actually removed. Instead, they are subtly and cleverly distributed among the remaining 12 bicyclists. Each of these 12 bicyclists becomes "larger" or more "complete" â€“ perhaps a torso segment is slightly elongated by aligning with a different part of the background, a tiny gap is filled by a sliver from the "vanished" figure, or body parts are recombined in a slightly different way.
3.  **Imperceptible Individual Change:** The change to each of the 12 remaining bicyclists is so small (e.g., each of the 12 figures might become 1/12th "more" of a figure) that it's usually not noticeable when looking at any single figure. Our eyes and brains tend to perceive them as complete figures in both states. However, collectively, these tiny additions or rearrangements perfectly account for the entirety of the "vanished" 13th bicyclist.

This type of puzzle, often called a "vanishing puzzle" or "line-up puzzle," masterfully highlights how our perception of number and form can be manipulated by the clever arrangement of lines and shapes.
